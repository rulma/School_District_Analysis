# School_District_Analysis

## Overview

We were tasked with conducting an analysis on School performance in the area. We summarized student success in both reading and writing and looked to see how school size, type, and per capita spending affected student outcomes. We were alerted that there were fraudulent reporting for Thomas High School's 9th grade class scores. We had to redo our analysis after removing these dishonest scores.

## Results

After updating our data set to remove all 9th grade results for math and reading from Thomas High School we noticed the following changes:

The Distract Summary Before:

As you can see there was a 0.1% drop in the overall passing rate for the district. The percent passing reading also fell by 0.3% and math fell by 0.2%.

The School Summary Before:

In the above we can see the drastic change in Thomas High School's performance relative to the other high schools. Math and Reading Scores plummeted over 20% for Thomas High School. 

Replacing these grades also affected the overall summary for schools in the district.

Results by school spending fell in the $630 - 644 range. Which just so happens to be the range that Thomas High School was spending on it students. We can see that change below.

School size averages where also affected negatively by Thomas' grade changes.

And lastly, Charter schools also saw an overall decrease in their performance in the district.

## Summary

In summary, we can see how our school district analysis was negatively affected by the fraudulent scores posted at Thomas High School. The loss of grades for the entire 9th grade class dragged down the averages for schools in Thomas' spending bucket. It also caused a percentage drop in Charter school performance across the district. Despite these changes the overall shift in average performance across schools was marginal. In most cases the percentage change was <1%. The greatest change we witnessed was the drop in overall charter performance before and after which saw nearly a 0.5% drop passing students.
